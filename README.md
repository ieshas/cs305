### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individual finanical plans for their cutomers inclusing savings, retirements, insurance, and investmants. The company was looking to modernize their operations and greatly improve on their security measures.

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I identidied and hid all false-positives. It's important to code securley as Artemis Fiancial deals with client's sensitive inforamtion. To keep clients safe and the company in good stnading with the public, we have to code secure.

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The dependency check was the most helpful as that's where all the information came from. The most challenging was creating a RESTFUL API. I used many YouTube tutorials in order for it to make sense to me.

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

While I made sure there were no vulnerabilities lest, in the future I would do countless tests to ensure nothing can be exploited.


### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Debugging first. Then I repeatedly ran dependency tests for new vulnerabilities.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Hands down Eclipse. I hated using eclipse in earlier classes as I've always struggled with it. Something clicked this time around and I felt much more at ease using it as my IDE.


### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Creating hashes in Java. Although, I never got to see the product in the end as I'm still struggling with localhost
